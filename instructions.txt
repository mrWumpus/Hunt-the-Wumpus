Welcome to 'Hunt the Wumpus'
    The Wumpus lives in a cave with 20 rooms. Each room
has three tunnels leading to the other rooms. (Look at a
dodecahedron to see how this works-if you don't know
what a dodecahedron is, ask someone.)

    HAZARDS:
Bottomless Pits - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them.
    If you go there, you fall into the pit (and lose!)
SuperBats - Two other rooms have superbats. If you 
    go there, a bat grabs you and takes you to some other 
    room at random. (Which might be troublesome.)

    WUMPUS:
The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (he has sucker
feet and is too big for a bat to lift). Usually
he is asleep. Two things wake him up: entering his room and
shooting an arrow.
    If the Wumpus wakes, he moves (P=.75) one room
or stays still (P=.25). After that, if he is where you
are, he eats you up (and you lose!)

    YOU:
Each turn you may move or shoot a crooked arrow
    MOVING: you can go one room (through a tunnel)
    ARROWS: You have five arrows. You lose when you run out.
    Each arrow can go from one to five rooms. You aim by telling
    the computer the rooms you want the arrow to go to.
    If the arrow can't go that way (i.e. no tunnel) it moves
    at random to the next room.
      If the arrow hits the Wumpus, you win.
      If the arrow hits you, you lose.

    WARNINGS:
When you are in one room away from Wumpus or hazard,
    the computer says:
Wumpus - 'I smell a Wumpus'
Bat    - 'Bats nearby'
Pit    - 'I feel a draft'
