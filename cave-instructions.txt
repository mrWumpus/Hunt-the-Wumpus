You have a choice of caves to play in. Some caves are 
easier than others. All caves have 20 rooms and 3 
tunnels leading from on room to the other rooms.

The caves are:
    1 - DODECAHEDRON   The rooms of this cave are on a
        12 sided object, each formin a pentagon.
        the rooms are at the corners of the pentagons.
        Each room has tunnels leading to 3 other rooms.

    2 - MOBIUS STRIP   This cave is two rooms wide and
        10 rooms around (like a belt). You will notice
        there is a half twist somewhere.

    3 - STRING OF BEADS   Five beads in a circle.
        Each bead is a diamond with a vertical
        cross-bar. The right & left corners lead
        to neighboring beads. (This one is difficult
        to play)

    4 - HEX NETWORK   Imageing a hex tile floor. Take
        a rectangle with 20 points (intersections)
        inside (4x4). Join right & left sides to make a
        cylinder. Then join the top & bottom to form a
        torus (doughnut).
        Have fun imagining this one!!

    Caves 1-4 are regular in a sense that each room
goes to three other rooms & tunnels allow two-way
traffic. Here are some 'irregular' caves:

    5 - DENDRITE WITH DEGENERACIES   Pull a plant from
        the ground. The roots & branches for a
        dendrite - i.e., there are no looping paths.
        Degeneracy means a) some roots connect to 
        themselves and b) some rooms have more than one
        tunnel to the same other room, i.e. 12 has
        two tunnels to 13.

    6 - ONE WAY LATTICE   Here all tunnels go one 
        way only. To return, you must go aroud the cave
        (about 5 moves).
